### Hi there 👋

I'm Nicolas Saputra Gunawan, a Cyber Security Analyst 💻 currently working at [PT. Defender Nusa Semesta (Defenxor)](https://www.defenxor.com/) 🍲🥡

I actively participate in CTF competitions with BINUS University's PETIR team, leading the Binary Exploitation stream and developing Stack and Heap Exploitation challenges. I'm also part of the international team ImaginaryCTF, where I contribute weekly PWN challenges. I am eager to expand my skills in cybersecurity and secure a role in it where I can make a significant impact. </p>
