### Hi there 👋

I'm Nicolas Saputra Gunawan also known as Brandy and I'm a Cyber Security Analyst 💻

<p align="justify">As an undergraduate cybersecurity student, I am deeply passionate about the field and excel in hands-on challenges. My interests are focused on Network Penetration Testing, Endpoint Forensic, Memory Forensic, and Malware Analysis, where I aim to make a significant impact.</p>

<p align="justify">I demonstrate my passion for cybersecurity through active participation in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. As a member of BINUS University's official CTF team, PETIR, I have contributed to numerous national and international victories. Within PETIR, I lead the Binary Exploitation stream and have developed several challenges for national university competitions, specializing in Stack and Heap Exploitation binaries.</p>

<p align="justify">Additionally, I am a member of the international CTF team, ImaginaryCTF, where I contribute weekly PWN challenges and in their annual CTF event, held publicly on CTFtime.</p>

<p align="justify">Currently, I am working as a Cyber Security Analyst at [PT. Defender Nusa Semesta (Defenxor)](https://www.defenxor.com/) 🏢. I am eager to further develop my skills in both blue team and red team tracks, constantly seeking opportunities to grow and contribute to the cybersecurity community.</p>
